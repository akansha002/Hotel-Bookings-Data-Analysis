#### It is estimated that approx 50millions bookings happened in a month.


This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.

 We will perform exploratory data analysis with python to get insight from the data using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
